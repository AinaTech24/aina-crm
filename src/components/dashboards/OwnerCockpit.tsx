 *   1. Headline (3) — Total Leads, Total Clients, Net Business
 *      (SIP book lives in the Firm Pulse strip above, not here)
 *   2. Monthly business (5) — SIP added, Lumpsum, Redemption, SIP rejected, stopped
 *   3. Attention queues (5) — Reviews due, Pending SR, Open complaints, High-AUM, Dormant
 *   4. Team & health (4) — Team tasks, DDQ score, Data quality score, Campaigns
 *   5. Trends — Lead conversion %, RM-wise business, 30-day net sales chart
