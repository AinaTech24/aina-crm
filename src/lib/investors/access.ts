/**
 * Client (investor) row-level access scope.
 *
 * RLS isolates by TENANT only — it does NOT slice a tenant's clients by who may
 * see them. That slice is the application's job, and it has to be applied in
 * EVERY query that returns a list of clients: the list page, the Excel export,
 * and the JSON API (which is also what the mobile app reads).
 *
 * Whether the slice applies at all is a PER-TENANT switch —
 * `tenants.restrict_user_data_scope`, default FALSE. Some firms run a shared
 * book where every RM serves every client; others need a hard wall between
 * books. Default-off means no existing firm's visibility changes until its
 * owner (or platform admin) deliberately turns the wall on.
 *
 * When the switch is ON (mirrors the capability matrix in lib/auth/rbac.ts):
 *   owner / compliance / back_office / ops  → the whole firm's book
 *   branch_head (with a branch)             → their branch only
 *   rm                                      → clients assigned to them
 *
 * When it is OFF every role that may view clients at all sees the whole book.
 * The capability gate is NOT part of the switch: a role with no client
 * capability (marketing …) is blocked either way, as the API has always done.
 *
 * Deliberately mirrors `lib/leads/access.ts`, which does the same job for the
 * pipeline. NOTE: lead scoping is unconditional and predates this switch —
 * turning this off does not widen lead visibility.
