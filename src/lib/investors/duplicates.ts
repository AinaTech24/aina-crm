/**
 * Possible-duplicate detection for the Clients list banner. Counts live (non-
 * merged, non-closed) clients that share a PAN or a normalised mobile with
 * another client — the candidates the merge tool should look at. Cheap enough
 * to run on the list page; the actual merge happens in /dashboard/duplicates.
 *
 * Timely because the Excel importer now allows duplicate PANs on purpose
 * (dedup_pan=false), so duplicates accumulate and need a visible nudge.
