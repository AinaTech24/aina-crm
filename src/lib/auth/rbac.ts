/**
 * Role-Based Access Control — the source of truth for "who can do what".
 *
 * The spec defines 7 roles (one platform + six tenant):
 *
 *   PLATFORM (lives under tenant_id = PLATFORM_TENANT_ID)
 *     1. platform_admin  — AINA super admin. Cross-tenant. Uses withPlatformAdmin().
 *
 *   TENANT-SCOPED (every MFD organisation)
 *     2. owner            — full access inside their MFD
 *     3. rm               — assigned leads / clients only
 *     4. back_office (ops)— operations: onboarding, transactions, KYC
 *     5. marketing        — campaigns + content; no investment data
 *     6. compliance       — DDQ + approvals + consents + SOPs
 *     7. team_member      — limited: assigned tasks only
 *
 * `branch_head` is a legacy/extra MFD role used to gate aggregated team views.
 * `investor` is reserved for the future client app and has no dashboard caps.
 *
 * Two layers of enforcement:
 *   - UI:  `can(roles, cap)` to hide / disable controls.
 *   - API: `require(roles, cap)` to throw 403 before mutating.
 *
 * Platform capabilities (creating tenants, suspending licenses, package
 * templates) live in the PLATFORM_CAPS list and are checked separately —
 * NOT through this `can()` matrix, because tenants must never grant them.
