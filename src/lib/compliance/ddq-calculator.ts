/**
 * Scoring note — "not applicable" defaults to 100.
 *
 * Several metrics divide by a population that can be empty (no RMs requiring
 * NISM, no AMC empanelments yet, no complaints filed). In those cases the SQL
 * COALESCEs the ratio to 100, i.e. "nothing to assess ⇒ nothing in breach".
 * This is intentional: a brand-new firm shouldn't be penalised for an empty
 * complaint register. The trade-off is that a genuinely-empty section reads as
 * 100% rather than N/A — the per-item AMFI DDQ checklist (audit-checklist page)
 * is the authoritative gap view; this score is the rollup headline.
