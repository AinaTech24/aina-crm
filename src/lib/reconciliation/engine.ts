/**
 * Three-way holdings reconciliation engine.
 *
 * For every (investor, scheme) it matches three legs and records a reviewable
 * exception when they disagree — unlike the old scanner, which only emitted
 * events and never produced a matched break list:
 *
 *   leg 1  CRM ledger units   Σ(inflow − outflow units) from `transactions`
 *   leg 2  RTA/CAS-stated     Σ units from `folios.schemes[]` (the feed snapshot)
 *   leg 3  live valuation     units × latest AMFI NAV (`scheme_nav`) → materiality
 *
 * Exception types:
 *   unit_mismatch   both legs have the scheme but units differ materially
 *   missing_in_crm  CAS shows units with no transaction trail in the CRM
 *   missing_in_feed CRM ledger implies units the CAS feed doesn't show
 *
 * Idempotent: upserts on (tenant, dedup_key) so a persistent break stays one
 * row; a break that healed since the last run is auto-resolved. Runs inside a
 * withTenant() tx (RLS scopes every table).
