/**
 * Persist live AUM. SERVER-ONLY (imports the DB).
 *
 * The headline finding of the platform audit: `investors.aum` (and the
 * `folios` rollup) were stored numbers populated at import and never
 * recomputed against live NAV — so firm AUM, RM scorecards, service-tiering,
 * the Excel export, the client review report and the commission "expected"
 * calc all drifted the moment NAV moved. These helpers close that gap by
 * revaluing against the live AMFI NAV feed (`scheme_nav`).
 *
 *   recomputeAllAum(tx)      — investors.aum = net units × latest NAV, set-based,
 *                              for every investor in the current tenant context
 *                              that has a transaction basis. Investors with NO
 *                              completed transactions are left untouched (we have
 *                              nothing better than their imported figure — never
 *                              zero a book we can't value).
 *   revalueAllFolios(tx)     — refresh folios.aum + each folios.schemes[].nav/value
 *                              by repricing the CAS-sourced units at live NAV
 *                              (units are authoritative from the feed; only NAV ×
 *                              value are refreshed). Powers the review report and
 *                              the commission reconciler's expected-AUM.
 *
 * Both run inside a withTenant() tx (RLS scopes the rows). They mirror the
 * exact valuation logic in src/lib/finance/valuation.ts (priced holdings only,
 * dust units treated as fully redeemed).
