/**
 * Team Dashboard aggregation — the manager's "how is my team doing + who's
 * accountable" view, modelled on three lenses:
 *
 *   OPEN     — pending workload right now (overdues, due-today, open leads ₹,
 *              meetings, service requests, SIP bounces)
 *   PERIODIC — activity that happened today (created / completed / added)
 *   RESULT   — outcomes over a date range (completed tasks, converted vs lost
 *              leads with ₹, completed meetings, new clients + AUM)
 *
 * Plus a per-RM accountability roll-up (who owns the overdues / pipeline /
 * results) — the drill-down that turns a firm number into a person.
 *
 * Read-only, tenant-scoped via RLS (withTenant). Every metric carries a deep
 * link to the already-filtered module list so a click lands on the records.
