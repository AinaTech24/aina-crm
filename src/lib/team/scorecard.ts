/**
 * Team Performance — KRA scorecard engine.
 *
 * Computes per-person KPIs for the Sales and Operations teams from data the CRM
 * already holds (business entries, investors, leads, activities, review
 * meetings, service requests, tasks, attendance), scores each KPI, and rolls up
 * a weighted KRA score + RAG band per person.
 *
 * V1 scoring is target-free and robust: count KPIs are scored relative to the
 * team's best (a leaderboard), %-KPIs (SLA / attendance / conversion) are scored
 * on their own absolute value, and "lower-is-better" KPIs (overdue) invert.
 * Per-person absolute targets can layer on later.
