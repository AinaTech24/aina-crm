/**
 * Stage prerequisites for the Lead → Client journey.
 *
 * Every manual advance from stage A → B asks: "what should already exist
 * before we move on?" — captured here as a checklist of artefacts:
 *
 *   - completed meeting (for meeting_done)
 *   - risk profile response (for risk_profiled)
 *   - proposal in sent status (for proposal_sent)
 *   - approval evidence row (for proposal_approved)
 *   - … and so on.
 *
 * Each prerequisite carries:
 *   - a human label ("A scheduled meeting must exist")
 *   - a boolean `satisfied` computed against the DB
 *   - an optional `cta { href, label }` linking the user straight to the
 *     page where they can complete it.
 *
 * The transitionTo engine refuses to advance when any prerequisite is
 * unsatisfied (unless systemBypass=true is passed for auto-advance from
 * actions like "meeting completed" — the system already knows the
 * artefact exists because it just created it).
 *
 * Why this matters: stages are how the firm signals readiness for the
 * next step. Advancing without the underlying artefacts produces
 * compliance gaps later (e.g. proposal_sent with no proposal on file).
