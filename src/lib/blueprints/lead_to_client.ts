/**
 * Lead → Client SOP — full branching workflow.
 *
 * Redesigned from the previous linear 15-stage journey to a real
 * state-graph that mirrors how an MFD firm actually operates:
 *
 *   LEAD MODULE (stages 1-10) — owns the discovery + qualification phase
 *     1. New Lead Created                 (root)
 *     2. Call Done                        (first contact made)
 *     3. Call Back Later                  (snooze, RM will retry)
 *     4. Call Not Connected               (no answer; circle back)
 *     5. Contact in Future                (long-term nurture)
 *     6. Meeting Scheduled                (appointment confirmed)
 *     7. Meeting Pending                  (awaiting client confirm)
 *     8. Meeting Done                     (meeting held + outcome captured)
 *     9. Won Lead                         (qualified; ready to convert)
 *    10. Not Qualified                    (dead-end, lost)
 *
 *   CLIENT MODULE (stages 11-30) — owns the onboarding + activation
 *    11. Request Documents               (doc-collection link sent)
 *    12. Documents Pending               (waiting on client)
 *    13. Documents Received              (uploads complete)
 *    14. KYC Validated                   (KRA returns OK)
 *    15. KYC Registered                  (initial KYC capture)
 *    16. KYC Pending                     (KRA verifying)
 *    17. Modify KYC                      (data tweak needed)
 *    18. Physical KYC                    (offline verification path)
 *    19. Online KYC                      (e-KYC via Aadhaar)
 *    20. UCC Create                      (BSE/NSE code creation in progress)
 *    21. UCC Activated                   (exchange code live)
 *    22. Mandate Create                  (SIP mandate registration in progress)
 *    23. Mandate Activated               (NACH mandate live)
 *    24. Mandate Rejected                (re-do — bank failure)
 *    25. Make Transaction                (first investment kick-off)
 *    26. Transaction Successful          (units allotted)
 *    27. Transaction Failed              (re-do — payment issue)
 *    28. Family Mapping                  (linked to family / household)
 *    29. Update Information              (client master enriched)
 *    30. Active Client (in Review Sheet) (terminal — in review cycle)
 *
 * Branching rules:
 *   - From the root (`new`), 4 branches: Call Done / Call Back Later /
 *     Call Not Connected / Contact in Future
 *   - From Meeting Done: Proposal Sent, Won Lead OR Not Qualified
 *   - From Proposal Sent: Won Lead OR Not Qualified (or another meeting)
 *   - From KYC branches: 3 paths (Validated / Registered / Pending)
 *   - From Mandate: Activated OR Rejected (retry to Create)
 *   - From Transaction: Successful OR Failed (retry to Make Transaction)
 *   - "Won Lead" is the lead → client cut-over point (boundary).

/**
 * Stage-key → stepper flavour.
 *
 * `flavour` has been declared on SeedStage since the blueprint shipped and is
 * documented there as the "visual marker for the stepper" — 12 of the 30 stages
 * set it (4 loops, 5 terminal failures, 2 terminal successes). It never reached
 * a screen: `blueprint_stages` has no `flavour` column, the seeder never wrote
 * one, so the API could not return it and the stepper drew branches, call-back
 * loops and dead ends exactly like linear steps. That is why the rail reads as a
 * nonsensical sequence — "KYC Validated" before "KYC Registered" before "KYC
 * Pending" are not three steps, they are three BRANCHES, and "Not Qualified"
 * sitting between "Won Lead" and "Request Documents" is a dead end, not step 10.
 *
 * Resolved from the seeded catalogue by key rather than added as a column: every
 * tenant is seeded from this same list, the keys are stable, and a stage a firm
 * invented in the Blueprint Designer simply falls back to "default" instead of
 * requiring a migration and a backfill across every tenant.
