/**
 * Aina CRM Copilot — scope gate.
 *
 * Classifies each request BEFORE any tool or LLM runs. Off-topic requests
 * (general knowledge, sports, jokes, etc.) get a standard refusal — never
 * answered from model knowledge, never sent to a tool, never learned.
 * Investment-advice requests get the compliant "authorized advisor" decline.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative: any CRM/business signal keeps the request in scope,
 * so we don't wrongly refuse a real question the engine happens to phrase-miss.
