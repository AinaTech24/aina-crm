/**
 * Aina CRM Copilot — business-communication drafting (P4).

 * Produces ready-to-send DRAFTS for the common MFD outreach scenarios across

 * it hands the user polished, compliant text to copy into their channel. Every
 * money-adjacent draft carries the standard market-risk disclaimer, and none
 * promise returns or recommend a scheme (the compliance line the product holds).
