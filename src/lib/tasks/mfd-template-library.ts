/**
 * MFD Task Template Library — a researched, ready-to-use set of Standard
 * Operating Procedures for an Indian Mutual Fund Distributor's day-to-day
 * financial + service work. Each entry is a MAIN task with the exact sub-tasks
 * (checklist) needed to execute it end-to-end so a team member can pick it up
 * and run it without confusion.
 *
 * The admin installs these into the tenant's `task_templates` (one click); the
 * team then applies a template from the New Task form and DELEGATES individual
 * sub-tasks to teammates (each delegate is notified and can open the task).
 *
 * Sub-tasks are ordered as the real operational flow (cut-off timing, KYC/UCC/
 * mandate prerequisites, platform execution on BSE Star MF / NSE NMF II, RTA
 * (CAMS/KFintech) confirmation, client communication, CRM record + filing).
 *
 * `taskType` maps to the CRM's fixed enum (follow_up | review_meeting |
 * collect_document | kyc_renewal | custom); the financial transactions use
 * "custom".
