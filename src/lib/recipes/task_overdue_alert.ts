/**
 * Task Overdue Alert (M18 automation #1)
 *
 * Triggered when a task crosses its `due_at` and is still `open`.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Notify the assignee (in-app + WhatsApp) immediately.
 *   2. Wait 24 hours.
 *   3. If still not done (handled by re-check at firing time), escalate to the
 *      assignee's RM/owner via in-app alert + email.
 *
 * The trigger is wired by the workflow runner whenever an event of kind
 * `task.overdue` lands in events_outbox — see workers/master-scheduler.ts which
 * scans `tasks WHERE due_at < now() AND status = 'open'` every 15 minutes.
