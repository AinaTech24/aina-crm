/**
 * Goal drift alert.
 *
 * Per MFD-scaling research: goal-based advice is what converts a "SIP seller"
 * into a "wealth practice". When a goal drifts >10% behind the trajectory it
 * needs to hit its target, we alert the RM and send a WA prompt to the
 * investor to discuss a top-up.
 *
 * Trigger:  schedule (daily 07:00 IST)
 * Criteria: goal.status='active' AND progress_pct < expected_progress_pct - 10
 *           (expected_progress_pct is computed daily by a worker job that
 *            updates goals.progress_pct + an `expected_progress_pct` column
 *            from started_on + target_date.)
 *
 * Actions (sequenced):
 *   1. WhatsApp to investor — "Your <goal> is behind. Quick call?"
 *   2. Create RM task — "Goal review with <investor> — discuss top-up"
 *   3. Tag investor with 'goal_drift_alert' so segments can pick them up
