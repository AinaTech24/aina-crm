/**
 * GET /api/reports/data-hygiene
 *
 * Quick data-quality scan across the tenant's investor master. Returns
 * counts of clients missing each critical field — drives the "Data gaps"
 * tile on the Owner Cockpit and powers the deep-link to the filtered
 * Clients list where the user can bulk-fix.
 *
 * Cheap query: one SELECT with COUNT(*) FILTER (...) — single index
 * scan on investors(tenant_id, status). Tested fine to 100K clients.
 *
 * Each gap row has:
 *   - key   — machine identifier
 *   - label — human label
 *   - count — number of investors missing this field
 *   - href  — link to the Clients list pre-filtered to the bad rows
 *   - severity — "high" if compliance-relevant (PAN, KYC), else "medium"
