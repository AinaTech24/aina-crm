/**
 * GET /api/dashboard/my-day?date=YYYY-MM-DD
 *
 * The field salesperson's daily driver: the ACTUAL actionable items for the day
 * (not just counts) + relationship touchpoints for the week. One round-trip:
 *   - meetings     : the day's scheduled/confirmed review meetings (+ client phone)
 *   - followups    : leads whose next follow-up falls on the day
 *   - tasks        : tasks due on the day
 *   - touchpoints  : client birthdays + investment anniversaries in the next 7 days
 *   - agenda       : per-day counts for the next 14 days — drives the Home week strip
 *
 * `date` defaults to today. When the day IS today, follow-ups and tasks also pull
 * in anything OVERDUE (flagged `overdue`) — what an RM owes doesn't disappear at
 * midnight. Future/past days are strictly day-scoped.
 *
 * Scope mirrors the other surfaces: firm-wide for managers, own-book for RMs.
 * Each block fails soft to [] so one schema difference never 500s the home screen.
