/**
 * GET /api/dashboard/home
 *
 * The native mobile Home screen's data. The web role dashboards (OwnerCockpit,
 * RmDashboard, …) render server-side with no JSON API, so this endpoint exposes
 * the same headline numbers as a compact, mobile-friendly payload: a few KPI
 * cards + a "Today" worklist of actionable counts that deep-link into filtered
 * lists.
 *
 * Scope mirrors the list endpoints: firm-wide for owner/back-office/ops/
 * compliance/branch-head; own-book (rm_id = me) for RMs. Each metric is computed
 * independently and fails soft to 0, so a schema difference never 500s Home.
