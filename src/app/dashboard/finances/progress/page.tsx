/**
 * Monthly Progress (Network FP 8.5) — firm annual targets vs computed actuals.
 *
 * Actuals are derived live: new clients (investors.onboarded_at), leads
 * (leads.created_at), meetings done (review_meetings completed), AUM addition
 * (net successful transactions), SIP book addition (new sips), lumpsum added
 * (successful purchase/lumpsum inflows). Targets come from business_targets.
 *
 * Gated by reports.commission. FY via ?fy=YYYY-YY.
