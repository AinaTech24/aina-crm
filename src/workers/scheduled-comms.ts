/**
 * Scheduled communications drain.
 *
 * Compose lets an RM schedule an email for later — that lands a
 * `communications` row with status='scheduled' + scheduled_at. This worker
 * ticks every minute, finds due rows across all tenants, and fires each one in
 * place via sendScheduledEmail() (which re-checks consent + compliance before
 * the adapter call — consent can be revoked between scheduling and sending).
 *
 * Each row is processed in its own system transaction so one failure can't roll
 * back the rest of the batch. The `comms_scheduled_idx` makes the due-scan cheap.
