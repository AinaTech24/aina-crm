/**
 * RTA import worker.
 *
 * Parsing a real RTA master (CAMS R9 / KFintech MFSD — a ~10 MB zip that
 * expands to a large spreadsheet) is CPU- and memory-heavy: it OOM-crashed or
 * event-loop-blocked the WEB server when done inside the upload request,
 * 503-ing the whole site for every user. So the upload route now only records
 * the import row + enqueues a job here; this worker does the actual work in the
 * isolated worker process (concurrency 1 — one heavy parse at a time).
 *
 * Flow per job:
 *   1. mark the rta_file_imports row `parsing`
 *   2. fetch the object from S3 by key, checksum it (dedupe)
 *   3. unzip (password) if needed, decode to canonical pipe text
 *   4. run processRtaFile() in one tenant transaction
 *   5. update the row with status + counters (completed | partial | failed | rejected)
 *
 * A reaper marks rows stuck in `parsing` (worker died mid-job) as failed so the
 * UI poll resolves instead of spinning forever.
