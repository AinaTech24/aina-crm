-- 0192 — Inbound RTA mail log (the "did my forward actually arrive?" view)
--
-- Before this, a forwarded mailback that ROUTED successfully left behind only a
-- `last_received_at` timestamp on rta_forward_addresses — no sender, no subject,
-- no attachment list. And a mail that FAILED to route went to
-- rta_inbound_quarantine, which had no UI at all. Both made "is forwarding
-- working?" a question you could only answer by SSH-ing to the box and grepping
-- worker logs.
--
-- This table logs EVERY message the poller touches — routed or not — with the
-- per-attachment classification verdict, so Aina Admin can answer that question
-- on one screen.
--
-- Supersedes rta_inbound_quarantine (rows are migrated in below; the old table is
-- left in place, unread, rather than dropped — it costs nothing and keeps this
-- migration reversible).
