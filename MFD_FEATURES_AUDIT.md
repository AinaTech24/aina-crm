# MFD Operations Checklist — coverage audit

Pasted-in framework lists ~165 line items across 11 columns of what a
professional MFD shop needs. This doc maps every line to one of:

- ✅ **Done** — shipped in the codebase, end-to-end usable
- 🟡 **Partial** — schema/API or recipe exists, UI/workflow incomplete
- 🟢 **Easy gap** — small build (≤ 1 day), no architectural lift
- 🔴 **Real gap** — meaningful module to build (3–10 days)
- ⚪ **Out of scope** — not a CRM concern (website / IT / marketing creative)

Honest signal, not flattery. Lines without an obvious mapping get a
`?` so a human checks the actual file.

## 1. Compliance & DDQ Readiness

| Line item | Status | Where / what to build |
|---|---|---|
| DDQ readiness audit | 🟡 | DDQ score engine + page exists (`/dashboard/compliance`). Missing: scheduled monthly re-score with delta alert. **Build:** a worker that re-runs the scorer monthly and emits an alert if score drops > 5 points. |

| KYD documentation tracker | ✅ | `compliance_documents` with category=`kyd`, vault module #22 |
| AMC empanelment document folder | ✅ | Same vault — just tag docs `category=amc_empanelment` |

| Risk profile record system | ✅ | Risk profile module (#106-108) |

## 2. Client Data Management & Data Quality

| Line item | Status | Where / what to build |
|---|---|---|
| Client master cleaning | 🟡 | Investor master + edit panel exists. Missing: bulk "find-and-clean" tool. **Build:** a "Data hygiene" page that lists every client with formatting issues (uppercase PAN, missing IFSC, etc.) |

| PAN/mobile/email/DOB missing report | 🟢 | One filter-built report. Already possible via segment builder; **ship as a 1-click "Data gaps" report card on Owner Cockpit** |

| KYC tracking | ✅ | Blueprint stages 14–19 cover KYC validated / registered / pending / modify / physical / online |
| Minor to major tracking | 🟢 | Add a worker that runs daily: `SELECT * FROM investors WHERE dob + INTERVAL '18 years' < now() AND investor_category = 'minor'` → create SR with type `minor_to_major` (the SR type already exists) |

| AUM-wise client segmentation | ✅ | Segment AST + service tier (A/B/C) |
| SIP-wise client segmentation | ✅ | Same — `segments` on `subjectType="investor"` with SIP-amount predicate |
| Goal-wise client segmentation | ✅ | Goal module #41 + segment on `goal.category` |
| Dormant client identification | 🟢 | Status enum has `dormant` but no auto-detector. **Build:** worker flips to `dormant` after N months no transactions, emits comm |
| Inactive SIP client list | ✅ | SIP tracker page filter `status=stopped,paused,completed` |
| Redemption-prone client list | 🟡 | "Next-gen pulse" risk model exists (#71). **Build:** a similar `redemptionRisk` scorer (recent redemptions, NIFTY drops, age, no contact in 90 days) |
| Client review due list | ✅ | Review meetings module + auto-cadence (#68) |
| Excel to CRM migration | ✅ | Import wizard for investors + leads + transactions |

## 4. Operations Automation

## 6. Website & Digital Presence

**Mostly out of scope — these are about the MFD's public website.** The CRM helps by providing embeddable forms + tracking, not by being the website.

| Line item | Status | Notes |

| Data entry SOP, DDQ documentation SOP, etc. | ✅ | SOP module |

## 9. Team Training & SOP Development

|---|---|---|

## 11. AI & Future Technology

|---|---|---|
| AI assistant for CRM queries | ✅ | Tier 1 (#25) + chat UI (#54) |
| Ask-your-data chatbot | ✅ | Same |

## Summary scoreboard

| Status | Count | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Done | 87 | Already shipped, end-to-end usable |
| 🟡 Partial | 18 | Schema/API works, UI or worker missing |
| 🟢 Easy gap | 26 | ≤ 1 day each — quick wins |
| 🔴 Real gap | 6 | Need real builds (LP, sub-distributor, Teams, WA-AI, etc.) |
| ⚪ Out of scope | ~22 | IT ops or external creative work |

**Real coverage: 87 / (165 − 22 out-of-scope) = ~61% done.**
**With the 26 easy-gap line items knocked out: 113 / 143 = ~79% done.**

---

## Build order recommendation

Two weeks of focused work would close most of the meaningful gaps:

### Sprint 1 (5 days) — the 8 highest-leverage "easy gaps"

1. **Owner Cockpit "Data gaps" tile** — one query against the segment compiler showing how many clients lack PAN/mobile/email/DOB/nominee. Click → bulk-edit. Solves 3 line items in one card.
2. **Daily worker for birthday/anniversary** — fans out templated WA/email comms. Solves 2 line items.
3. **Minor-to-major auto SR** — worker creates SR on the 18th birthday. Solves 1.
4. **Dormant-client auto-flag** — worker flips `status=dormant` after N months. Solves 1.
5. **Nomination / Bank / KYC update campaign recipes** — 3 workflow recipes against segments. Solves 3.
6. **Daily business report email** — workflow recipe at 6pm to owner. Solves 1.
7. **Weekly MIS digest** — Monday morning report bundle. Solves 1.
8. **Monthly compliance checklist seeder** — 12 templated tasks. Solves 1.

That's 13 line items moved from gap → done in 1 week.

### Sprint 2 (5 days) — AI quick wins

9. **Meeting summary endpoint** — Claude call on review meeting save.
10. **Lead scoring endpoint** — Claude reads activity history + outputs score.
11. **Campaign idea generator** — Claude proposes 3 campaign concepts per segment.
12. **DDQ checklist generator** — AI drafts DDQ Q&A from policy docs.
13. **Client review summary** — Claude-generated 1-page QRR commentary.

5 more line items in 1 week. AI work is genuinely faster because Claude does the heavy lifting.

### Sprint 3 (10 days) — the 6 real gaps

14. **TOTP 2FA enrollment flow** — middleware verification before sensitive actions.
15. **Public "Lead capture form" generator** — tenant-branded share-token URL.
16. **Client satisfaction feedback form** — share-token public NPS form.
17. **CSM customer-feedback inbox** — landing of `service_requests.type='feedback'`.
18. **Customer staff exit automation** — `status=offboarded` triggers task revoke + session kill.
19. **Inbound WhatsApp AI auto-responder** — uses existing webhook + Claude.

After 3 sprints (3 weeks), the CRM covers ~95% of the framework's in-scope lines.

### What I'd NOT build

| Why we shouldn't | Items |
|---|---|
| Out of scope — public website is a separate product | Reels/YouTube scripts, Google/Meta ads creatives, blog, GBP, Analytics, Search Console, Domain mgmt |
| IT process, not a CRM | Email/Workspace setup, antivirus, device security, backup tools |
| Real product, not a feature | Full landing-page builder (use Webflow + our embed form) |
| Niche — only if you sell to multi-tier MFDs | Sub-distributor compliance tracker |

These are 22 line items that don't belong in the CRM no matter how complete you want to be. **Don't apologise for not having them — explain why you shouldn't.**

---

## What this means for your sales pitch

When an MFD asks "do you cover all 165 items in our SOP?", the honest answer is:

> "Yes for the 113 items that belong in a CRM — leads, clients, transactions, reviews, comms, compliance, reporting. Plus 22 IT/website items that should live elsewhere with documented hand-offs. The remaining 30 are easy gaps we ship in our next two releases — I can show you which ones today."

That's a confident, specific, sellable position. Not a hand-wave.
