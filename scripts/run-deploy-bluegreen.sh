# Zero-downtime blue-green deploy for the single-box prod stack.
# Installed on the server as ~/run-deploy.sh. Run detached:
#   nohup bash ~/run-deploy.sh > ~/deploy-current.log 2>&1 &
# then poll ~/deploy-current.log for DEPLOY_DONE_EXIT=0.
#
# Flow: prune -> build (heap-bounded) -> migrate -> start IDLE colour ->
#       wait until it's healthy -> stop the OLD colour. Caddy load-balances
#       across both colours with retry, so users never see the cutover.
# Safety: if the new colour never turns healthy, we stop it and LEAVE the old
#         colour serving — a failed deploy causes ZERO downtime.
