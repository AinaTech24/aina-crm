/**
 * backfill-demo-nav — DEMO-DATA CONVENIENCE ONLY.
 *
 * The seeded demo book uses synthetic scheme codes ("HDFC-TOP100", "ICICI-EQ-001")
 * that obviously don't exist in AMFI's feed, so the valuation engine can't price
 * them. Real MFD data imported from CAMS/KFintech carries genuine AMFI codes /
 * ISINs and prices natively — this script is NOT needed in production.
 *
 * For the demo, it maps each unpriced demo scheme code to the best-matching real
 * AMFI scheme by NAME (trigram similarity, preferring the Regular-plan Growth
 * option) and inserts an ALIAS row into scheme_nav keyed by the demo code, so
 * the join in valuation.ts resolves to a real, live NAV. Alias rows are tagged
 * in scheme_name so they're obvious, and they simply go stale after the next
 * `refresh:nav` (they're not in the AMFI feed) — harmless for a demo DB.
 *
 * Usage:  DEMO_TENANT_ID=<id> npx tsx scripts/backfill-demo-nav.ts --tenant <id>
 *
 * Phase 3H guard: this used to run with NO tenant filter — its unit/NAV rewrite
 * matched every firm's transactions whose scheme_code is a real AMFI code, and
 * its name-matched alias rows went into the GLOBAL scheme_nav every firm prices
 * from. It now runs for one named demo firm only (--tenant must equal
 * DEMO_TENANT_ID), never in production, and refuses a firm that has any RTA
 * import, RTA activation, or a transaction from a registrar feed.
